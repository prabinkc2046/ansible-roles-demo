1. To gathers the fact about the target host system, 
if gathering=implicit in ansible.cfg,then set gather_facts: True on the play level
if gathering=explicit in ansible.cfg, then by default, it will gather facts.
To save the information gathering time, set gather_facts: false

2. To see the ansible_facts on the host system, use this:
- name: List the ansible_facts of the host
  debug:
    var: ansible_facts

3. To see the list of modules, use this:
ansible-doc -l

4. To see the current ansible setting:
ansible-config dump

5. To know the variables list to use in ansible.cfg:
ansible-config init

6. To see which config or setting is effective:
ansible-config view

7. Verifying playbook
Verify if the playbook produces the intended effect by using the check mode:
ansible-play playbooks/install-nginx.yml --check
This will not make any changes in the system but will let us know the actual effect it would take if running without --check.
Some of the modules might not support the --check mode, in that case, that task will be skipped.

8. Verifying playbook with --diff mode
--diff mode will shows the comparision between before and after running the ansible playbook
ansible-play playbooks/configure.nginx.yml --diff

9. Both --check and --diff mode can be used together to verify playbook

10. Check the systax error:
ansible-playbook nginx.yml --syntax-check

11. Use ansible-lint to check the health of playbooks
ansible-lint playbook/system-setup.yml

12. Install ansible as follow:
Upgrade pip3:
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

After upgrade, Install ansible-lint:
pip3 install ansible-lint

If ansible-lint is not in the PATH, add it to the path:
path to directory where anisble-lint is situated: /home/user/.local/bin
Open ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile with nano or vi and append this line:
export PATH="$PATH:/home/user/.local/bin"
and then 
source ~/.bashrc to make the change effective

13. Ansible condition
- name: Install nginx on Debian
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'

- name: Install nginx on Redhat
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'
