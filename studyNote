1. To gathers the fact about the target host system, 
if gathering=implicit in ansible.cfg,then set gather_facts: True on the play level
if gathering=explicit in ansible.cfg, then by default, it will gather facts.
To save the information gathering time, set gather_facts: false

2. To see the ansible_facts on the host system, use this:
- name: List the ansible_facts of the host
  debug:
    var: ansible_facts

3. To see the list of modules, use this:
ansible-doc -l

4. To see the current ansible setting:
ansible-config dump

5. To know the variables list to use in ansible.cfg:
ansible-config init

6. To see which config or setting is effective:
ansible-config view

7. Verifying playbook
Verify if the playbook produces the intended effect by using the check mode:
ansible-play playbooks/install-nginx.yml --check
This will not make any changes in the system but will let us know the actual effect it would take if running without --check.
Some of the modules might not support the --check mode, in that case, that task will be skipped.
